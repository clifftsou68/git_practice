# QuantDesk

QuantDesk is an educational desktop application for market analysis, trade signal generation,
and paper-trading alerts. It provides a configurable strategy DSL powered by YAML/JSON files and
an offline-friendly backtesting engine for discretionary review. The project is designed for
research onlyâ€”**not** financial advice.

## Features

- Pluggable data providers with caching (Yahoo Finance demo provider included)
- Configurable universe filters and indicator pipeline
- Declarative signal rules with portfolio risk management
- Lightweight backtesting with rich performance metrics
- Paper-trading loop with alert fan-out (desktop toasts, email, webhooks)
- PyQt6 desktop shell with Dashboard, Screener, Strategy, Backtest, Paper Trade, Logs, and
  Settings tabs (optional)
- YAML (JSON-compatible) strategy files with hot reload
- SQLite storage for results and application state
- Packaging via Poetry and PyInstaller (one-file Windows EXE)
